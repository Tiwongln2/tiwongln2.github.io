        <div>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li> <b> Where do you come from? </b> I'm from a place called Jackson, TN, a city between Memphis & Nashville. </li>
                <li> <b> Why computer science? </b> At age 13, I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes; this changed my life forever. Seeing how the technology developed has saved my life
                  inspired me to pursue something in tech. When I reached high school, I took a Web Design course & knew immediately CS was the route for me. Through CS, I know I can impact
                  others in the same way it impacted me. </li>
                <li> <b> What are you up to now? </b> Currently, I'm a junior studying Computer Science & Mathematics at Morehouse College. </li>
                <li> <b> What career aspirations/goals do you have for post-grad life? </b> I'm definitely looking to work in industry full-time, and possibly going to grad school for research
                  opportunities. In terms of CS work, as long as it involves coding, I'm open to opportunities :) </li>
                <li> <b> What do you enjoy outside CS? </b> I'm an avid Marvel and The Walking Dead fan. You can always catch me watching the newest shows & reading new material for these
                  universes. I love weightlifting, jump rope, and wrestling, as exercise is a big routine for me. Once the cold dissipates, I plan to refactor my garden.
                  I'm also an aspiring investor. </li>
